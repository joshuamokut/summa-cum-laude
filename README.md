Java project at university, third year first semester... calculates travel time between two locations within Kazan

this is a simple boring java project, It just take 2 addresses fromt the user and geocodes them using yandex geocoding API, extracts their
geographical coordinates, then sends this geographical cordinates to google maps distance matrix API and gets the estimated time of travel and distance betwwen the two addresses. I know, its useless... but the teacher wanted a project and hitler wanted to rule the world but look what happened when he got to ambitious! I think I'm high on energy drinks , I'll go get some sleep now.
