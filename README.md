# summa-cum-laude
Java project at university, third year first semester... calculates travel time between two locations within Kazan

this is a simple and rather boring java project. It take 2 addresses from the user and geocodes them using yandex geocoding API, extracts their geographical coordinates. Then requests the estimated time of travel and distance between the two addresses using google distance matrix API. 

The purpose of this project was to get used to using API on java.
